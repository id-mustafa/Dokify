# `server/tsconfig.json`

This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the Node.js backend project. It defines how TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript, specifying target ECMAScript version, module system, output directory, and strictness of type checking.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this `tsconfig.json` file is to enable the compilation of a Node.js backend project. It ensures that:

*   TypeScript code is transpiled into a modern JavaScript version (`ES2022`).
*   The Node.js module resolution strategy (`NodeNext`) is used for accurate import handling.
*   All source files located in the `src/` directory are processed.
*   The compiled JavaScript output is placed in the `dist/` directory.
*   Strict type checking is enforced to catch potential errors during development.

## Key Configuration Options

The `compilerOptions` object within `tsconfig.json` dictates the behavior of the TypeScript compiler. Key options include:

*   **`target`**: `"ES2022"` - Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compiled JavaScript. `ES2022` provides access to the latest JavaScript features.
*   **`module`**: `"NodeNext"` - Defines the module system to use. `NodeNext` is the modern, recommended module resolution strategy for Node.js, supporting ES modules.
*   **`moduleResolution`**: `"NodeNext"` - Instructs the TypeScript compiler on how to resolve module imports, aligning with Node.js's `NodeNext` strategy.
*   **`outDir`**: `"dist"` - Specifies the output directory where the compiled JavaScript files will be placed.
*   **`rootDir`**: `"src"` - Indicates the root directory of the source files. This helps the compiler structure the output directory correctly.
*   **`strict`**: `true` - Enables all strict type-checking options. This is highly recommended for robust code and early error detection.
*   **`esModuleInterop`**: `true` - Simplifies the interoperation between CommonJS and ES modules, making it easier to import CommonJS modules in an ES module context.
*   **`skipLibCheck`**: `true` - Instructs the compiler to skip type checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`). This can significantly speed up compilation times.

## Inputs

The TypeScript compiler, when using this configuration, will process:

*   All files within the `src/` directory and its subdirectories, as specified by the `include` property: `"src/**/*"`.
*   The configuration options defined within this `tsconfig.json` file itself, such as `target`, `module`, `outDir`, etc.

## Outputs

The primary output of the TypeScript compilation process is:

*   A `dist/` directory containing the compiled JavaScript files, ready for execution by Node.js.

## Invariants

*   All TypeScript source files are expected to be located within the `src/` directory.
*   The compiled JavaScript output will always reside in the `dist/` directory.
*   Strict type checking is enforced for all included source files.

## Error Handling

This configuration promotes robust error handling by enforcing strict type checking (`"strict": true`). This means the TypeScript compiler will flag type mismatches, uninitialized variables, and other potential errors during the compilation phase, preventing many runtime issues. Any compilation errors will halt the build process, requiring developers to address them before proceeding.

## Dependencies

This file itself has no direct runtime dependencies. However, it implicitly depends on:

*   **Node.js**: The target runtime environment for the compiled JavaScript.
*   **TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`)**: The tool that reads this configuration and performs the compilation.

## Examples

When you run the TypeScript compiler (e.g., `tsc`) in the project's root directory (where this `tsconfig.json` is located), it will:

1.  Read all `.ts` files within `server/src/`.
2.  Compile them according to the specified options (targeting ES2022, using NodeNext modules).
3.  Place the resulting `.js` files into the `server/dist/` directory, maintaining the source directory structure.

For instance, a file like `server/src/index.ts` might be compiled to `server/dist/index.js`.

## Pitfalls

*   **Forgetting to Run `tsc`**: The TypeScript code will not be usable by Node.js until the compiler has been run. This is typically handled by build scripts in `package.json`.
*   **Incorrect `rootDir` or `outDir`**: Mismatches between these settings and your actual project structure can lead to unexpected output locations or compilation failures.
*   **Ignoring Strictness**: While `strict: true` can feel verbose initially, disabling it can lead to subtle bugs that are hard to catch later.
*   **Module Resolution Issues**: Incorrectly configured `module` or `moduleResolution` can cause import errors, especially in projects with complex dependency graphs. `NodeNext` is generally the correct choice for modern Node.js projects.

## Related Files

*   **`package.json`**: Typically contains build scripts that invoke the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) using this `tsconfig.json` file.
*   **`src/` directory**: Contains all the TypeScript source code for the backend application.
*   **`dist/` directory**: The output directory for the compiled JavaScript code.
