# Dokify Web Application Dark Theme (theme.css)

This file defines the visual styling for the Dokify web application, establishing a dark-themed design system. It provides a consistent and cohesive look and feel across the application by defining color palettes, component styles, and layout utilities.

## Purpose

The primary goal of `theme.css` is to implement a dark, modern aesthetic for the Dokify web application. This is achieved through:

*   **Color Variables:** A set of CSS custom properties (`--var-name`) are defined to manage the application's color scheme. This includes a dark background palette (`--bg`, `--panel`, `--muted`), text colors (`--text`, `--subtle`), and a prominent blue accent (`--blue`, `--blue-600`, `--ring`).
*   **Component Styles:** Common UI elements such as buttons (`.btn`), input fields (`.input`), cards (`.card`), and navigation (`.nav`) are styled to align with the dark theme.
*   **Layout Utilities:** Classes like `.container`, `.row`, and `.stack` are provided to help structure the application's layout consistently.
*   **Visual Effects:** Subtle gradient effects and radial gradients are used to add depth and visual interest, particularly on cards and buttons.

## Key APIs/Classes/Functions

This file primarily consists of CSS rules that target specific HTML elements and custom classes. The most significant are:

### CSS Custom Properties (Variables)

These variables are defined within the `:root` selector and serve as the foundation of the theme's color palette.

*   `--bg`: The primary background color of the application.
*   `--panel`: A slightly lighter background color for panel-like elements.
*   `--muted`: A darker background color, often used for subtle separators or backgrounds.
*   `--text`: The primary color for application text.
*   `--subtle`: A lighter, more subdued text color for secondary information.
*   `--blue`: The main blue accent color.
*   `--blue-600`: A darker shade of the blue accent.
*   `--ring`: A translucent color used for focus rings, typically around interactive elements.

### Element and Class Selectors

*   `:root`: The pseudo-class where all global CSS custom properties are defined.
*   `html, body, #root`: These selectors ensure that the entire application occupies the full height of the viewport.
*   `body`: Sets the base `margin`, `background` color, and `color` for the entire document.
*   `.container`: Centers content and applies consistent padding.
    *   `max-width: 980px;`: Limits the maximum width of the content.
    *   `margin: 0 auto;`: Centers the container horizontally.
    *   `padding: 24px;`: Adds internal spacing.
*   `.card`: Styles visually distinct content blocks.
    *   Features a `linear-gradient` for the background, creating a subtle dark to slightly darker transition.
    *   Includes a `radial-gradient` with a blue accent, positioned at the top-left, adding a soft glow.
    *   `border: 1px solid #1f1f1f;`: A subtle dark border.
    *   `border-radius: 12px;`: Rounded corners.
    *   `padding: 24px;`: Internal spacing.
    *   `box-shadow`: Applies both a deep shadow and an inner glow using the blue accent color.
*   `.btn`: Styles buttons with a prominent, visually appealing appearance.
    *   `appearance: none;`: Removes default browser button styling.
    *   `border: 0; outline: 0;`: Removes default borders and outlines.
    *   `cursor: pointer;`: Indicates interactivity.
    *   `padding: 10px 16px;`: Button dimensions.
    *   `border-radius: 10px;`: Rounded corners.
    *   `color: white;`: White text color.
    *   `background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--blue), var(--blue-600));`: A gradient background using the blue accent colors.
    *   `box-shadow: 0 6px 16px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.4);`: A prominent shadow that emphasizes the button.
*   `.btn:focus`: Styles for buttons when they are in focus, providing visual feedback.
    *   `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px var(--ring);`: Adds a distinct ring around the button using the `--ring` variable.
*   `.input`: Styles input fields for consistency within the theme.
    *   `width: 100%;`: Occupies the full width of its parent.
    *   `padding: 10px 12px;`: Internal spacing.
    *   `border-radius: 8px;`: Rounded corners.
    *   `background: #0b0b0b;`: A dark background color.
*   `.row`, `.stack`: Layout utility classes for arranging elements. Specific styles for these are not detailed in the provided excerpt but are intended for common layout patterns.
*   `.muted`: A class for applying a muted style, likely for less prominent text or elements.
*   `.nav`: General styling for navigation elements.
*   `.link`: Styling for anchor tags (links).

## Inputs/Outputs

This CSS file does not take explicit inputs in the programming sense. Its "inputs" are the HTML structure it is applied to. The "outputs" are the visual rendering of those HTML elements according to the defined styles.

## Invariants

*   **Full Height Layout:** `html`, `body`, and `#root` are consistently set to `height: 100%`, ensuring the application utilizes the full viewport height.
*   **Dark Background:** The primary background (`--bg`) is black, establishing the dark theme foundation.
*   **Consistent Spacing:** Padding values like `24px` and `10px 16px` are used across various components for visual rhythm.
*   **Blue Accent:** The `--blue` and its variants are consistently used for interactive elements and highlights.

## Error Handling

CSS itself does not have explicit error handling mechanisms in the same way programming languages do. However, the design aims to prevent visual inconsistencies:

*   **Fallback Colors:** While not explicitly shown, well-structured CSS should ideally have fallbacks if custom properties were not supported (though this is rare in modern browsers).
*   **Specificity:** The order and specificity of CSS rules are crucial. For instance, `.btn:focus` will override `.btn` styles when the button is focused.

## Dependencies

*   **Browser Support:** This CSS file is designed for modern web browsers that support CSS Custom Properties (variables).
*   **HTML Structure:** The styles are dependent on the presence of specific HTML elements and classes (e.g., `.container`, `.card`, `.btn`, `.input`, `.nav`, `.link`).

## Examples

```html
<!-- Example of a card with content -->
<div class="card">
  <h2>Card Title</h2>
  <p>This is some content inside a card. It uses the defined dark theme styles.</p>
  <button class="btn">Click Me</button>
</div>

<!-- Example of an input field -->
<input type="text" class="input" placeholder="Enter something...">

<!-- Example of a button -->
<button class="btn">Submit</button>
```

## Pitfalls

*   **Over-reliance on Specific Colors:** Hardcoding colors instead of using variables can make theme updates difficult. This file correctly uses variables.
*   **Lack of Responsiveness:** While not explicitly shown in the excerpt, a complete theme would need to consider responsive design for various screen sizes. The `.container`'s `max-width` provides some baseline control.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Although custom properties are widely supported, older browsers might not render them correctly. For extensive legacy support, alternative methods or polyfills might be needed.
*   **Accessibility:** Sufficient color contrast between text (`--text`, `--subtle`) and backgrounds (`--bg`, `--panel`, `--muted`) is crucial for accessibility. This should be regularly reviewed.

## Related Files

*   **JavaScript files:** Any JavaScript code that dynamically manipulates styles or adds/removes classes would interact with this CSS file.
*   **Other CSS files:** This `theme.css` file likely serves as a foundational stylesheet. Other CSS files in the `web/src` directory might build upon or import styles from this file, or style specific components not covered here. For example, `components.css` or `layout.css` could exist.
